GitHub 本身不支持公式，因此请下载到本地使用 [Typora](https://www.typora.io/)观看。

The notes are from videos mostly.

The markdown files are written with typora. The graphs and equations cannot be rendered properly due the lack of Mathjax/Mermaid support in GitHub.



I do not know how to draw the PGM properly in markdown and here Mermaid is used.
