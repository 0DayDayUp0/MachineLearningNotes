# MachineLearningNotes
My personal notes based on https://www.bilibili.com/video/av70839977?from=search&seid=17463814830541838470 and pattern recognition and machine learning
The notes are from videos mostly.

The markdown files are written with typora. The graphs and equations cannot be rendered properly due the lack of Mathjax/Mermaid support in GitHub.



I do not know how to draw the PGM properly in markdown.
